# News App

<h3>Hi👋🏻<h3/>

  <p>
  📌In this news application that I developed with Flutter, we can get breaking news headlines from the API and search for articles from news sources and blogs.<br>
  📌We can also browse different news according to categories.<br>
  📌The newsapi.org site was used for the API.<br>
  📌WebView was used to navigate to news feeds and blogs.<br>
